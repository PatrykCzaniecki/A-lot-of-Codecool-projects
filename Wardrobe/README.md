# Wardrobe

Your task is to model a wardrobe. Clothes can be hanged into the wardrobe. 

- The wardrobe can accommodate only a certain number of hangers (the actual limit can vary between different wardrobes).
- All clothes must have a unique identifier, a brand name, and each one must have a type, which is different for different kinds of clothing: shirt, blouse, trousers or skirt.
- There are two types of hangers: one that can accommodate a single shirt or blouse only, and one that can accommodate a shirt or a blouse and at the same time trousers or a skirt too.
- You can hang in wardrobe cloth or hanger.
- A piece of clothing can only be hanged in the wardrobe if wardrobe has free hanger which can accomodate this kind of clothing.
- When placing a single hanger into the wardrobe make sure that you don’t allow more than physically possible.
- Hangers can be put into the wardrobe either empty or with some clothes on them.
- Clothes can be taken out of the wardrobe by their unique identifier.
- Clothes can be taken out of the wardrobe with or without hanger. 
- When cloth is taken with hanger and if it's hanger for two pieces, the whole hanger is taken out of the wardrobe, with the second cloth, if exists.
- Users of the wardrobe can test whether there’s an empty hanger inside the wardrobe that can be used for a particular type of clothing.
